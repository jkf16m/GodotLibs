# About components

These are reusable pieces of logic that can be used in any kind of project.
These components are organized by type.

The folder indicates what kind of parent node the component is meant to be used with (it can include abstract
types like "Node" or "Control").

The file name indicates what kind of functionality the component provides.

And for good measure, the component always have to implement the IComponent interface.

More details about IComponent inside the interface file.
